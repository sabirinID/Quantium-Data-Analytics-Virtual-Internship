Task 3: Analytics and Commercial Application
Use your analytics and insights from Task 1 and 2 to prepare a report for your client, the Category Manager.

# Background information on your task
We suggest you complete Tasks 1 and 2 before proceeding with this task. 

Task 3 is targeted specifically at building your ability to recognise commercial, actionable insights from your analysis and displaying it in a clear and concise way for your client, with minimal jargon. At Quantium, our analyst graduates sometimes work as what we like to call “hybrids” (a mix of analyst and consultant duties) so developing your presentation skills early is a huge win!

As both technical tasks 1 and 2 were open ended in terms of insights, this model answer will focus on the layout and the order of your inclusions, including where to include graphs, taglines, written insights and recommendations.

As part of Quantium’s retail analytics team, you have been conducting a range of analysis on transaction and purchase behaviour data to provide key recommendations to your client, the Category Manager of chips, who is putting together their strategic plan. 

# Task Brief
With our project coming to an end its time for us to send a report to Julia, based on our analytics from the previous tasks. We want to provide her with insights and recommendations that she can use when developing the strategic plan for the next half year.

As best practice at Quantium, we like to use the “Pyramid Principles” framework when putting together a report for our clients. If you are not already familiar with this framework you can find quick introductions on by searching form them on the internet.

For this report, we need to include data visualisations, key callouts, insights as well as recommendations and/or next steps.

We recommend you use a tool like PowerPoint (or similar) to create your report, we have also provided you a template to help get you started.

One way to create your visualisations (graphs, charts etc) is to save your output files from task 1 & 2 and create generate your charts in Excel. You may find it helpful to create chart templates however that is not essential. We are looking for consistency here – if a series is blue in one chart it needs to remain blue throughout the presentation. Once you have created the charts in your Excel file, paste them into your PowerPoint in the order that suits best.

When you have finished creating your report, remember to save it as a PDF and send it via email to the client so they can review it prior to our meeting next week.
